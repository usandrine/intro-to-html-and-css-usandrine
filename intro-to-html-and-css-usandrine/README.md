# Building The Expense Tracker Application Interface

## Assignment Description:
In this assignment, you will utilize your knowledge of HTML and CSS to create an expense tracker website. Your website will showcase a landing page, registration and login page, add, edit and view expenses pages. This assignment will help you practice structuring web pages using HTML and styling them with CSS.

## Requirements:

## HTML Structure:
        Create the below html files:
        index.html
        register.html
        login.html
        add_expense.html
        edit_expense.html
        view_expense.html
        
        Structure your HTML document with appropriate tags such as <html>, <head>, <title>, <section>, <div>, <form> and <body>.

## CSS Styling:
        Create a CSS file named styles.css.
        Style your website using CSS to make it visually appealing.
        Utilize CSS properties such as font-family, color, background-color, margin, padding, border, text-align, etc.
        Ensure your webiste is responsive and looks good on different screen sizes (desktop, tablet, mobile).

## GitHub Classroom:
        Submit the link to your GitHub repository through GitHub Classroom.
        Your submission will be automatically graded based on the correctness of your HTML structure, CSS styling, responsiveness, and organization of your GitHub repository.

## Additional Considerations:
        Use semantic HTML tags where appropriate (e.g., <header>, <section>, <article>, <footer>).
